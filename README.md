### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Frontend Developer with good design skills, in ðŸ’œ with TypeScript, React, CSS, and sensitive to accessibility and performances.

I like to improve things, and I'm comfortable in UI composition and CSS architecture.

I'm on Gitlab since my new position @ Fipto. I'll only use GitHub for my side projects.
