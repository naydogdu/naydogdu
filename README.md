### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an UX Developer with good design skills, in ðŸ’œ with CSS and focused on accessibility.

I love improving things, mostly design and markup ðŸ˜‹ ! I am also comfortable with making CSS architecture.

Currently at work, I mainly use Vue.js & TypeScript with Tailwind and PostCSS. But I use React.js whenever I can (all of my side projects, for example), because I love it (sorry Vue).

If you have a little time, feel free to check out my works.

Bye !
