### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an UX Developer with good design skills, in ðŸ’œ with CSS and focused on accessibility.

I like to improve things, mostly design and markup, and I'm comfortable in UI composition and CSS architecture.

Currently at work, I mainly use Vue.js & TypeScript, dabbled with TailwindCSS, PostCSS, Twig. I also use React.js on my side projects.

If you have a little time, feel free to check out my works.

Bye !
